# Digital Credit Card for Underserved/Undocumented People

We are building a digital card that replaces high APR payday loans with low APR instant digital credit cards that come with rewards incentives. The card issues both tokens and USD as loans, which are tracked on the blockchain, and activated via smart contracts. There are saving mechanisms built in to support building a financial safety piggy bank, which can be broken upon a financial emergency. Through this, the card promotes smart financial security to help those get out of financial poverty.
